# What is this?
This is a so-called Github Pages project (backed by a Git repo). It is accessible publicly via [meiedomi.github.io].
It contains a simple `Ã¬ndex.html` that redirects to the [wiki](https://github.com/meiedomi/meiedomi.github.io/wiki) of this project (also a separate Git repo).

# Purpose
The main content is on the wiki, consisting of a flat list of markdown files all relating to a different technical or conceptual topics surrounding the life of a programmer.
It is possible to upload arbitrary files as attachments as well, but those are not tracked with Git, but rather stored separately on Github's servers.

New entries to the wiki can easily be made directly in the browser, there is no need to checkout the Git and do it locally.
